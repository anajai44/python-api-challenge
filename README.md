# python-api-challenge

Its been a while since I learn about this module.
as I was working on the `WeatherPy.IYPN`. I struggled, setting the URL with the API keys and cities.
I kept getting for every city `City not found. Skipping...`, and I thought it was odd because it was for every city. Then, I signed up for tutoring, and I had my tutor look over my URL. The URL was causing this issue, and I needed to update the app.
I had the right concept, but wrong format, so my tutor walked me over that section and exaplained me the concept.
Asking for help was an easier way because I had time going over class recordings, but it was a little difficult, but with tutor it was easier.
After I finish the `WeatherPy.IYPN`, I struggled to find the `geoapify` for `VacationPy`. It was too late to ask the tutor since tutoring had finish earlier. I'm submitting what I have, and I'm scheduling another tutoring appointment to better help me find the `geoapify`in order to have access to that API and create my API Key for the section.
